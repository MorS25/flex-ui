    A <code>Badge</code> is a Wicket Component integration of
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#badges">bootstrap badges</a>.

      <section>
        <h2>Simple Badges</h2>

        <p>
          Badges render a <code>IModel</code> as body, usually this will be a integer. They can be wrapped by links,
          and they work transparently with bootstrap classes.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>BadgeList</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>BadgeList</code> component supports a dynamic list of badges by utilising the
          <code>BadgeListItem</code> class. A specific application would provide a css that renders the list nicely.
        </p>
        <ul wicket:id="badge-list">[]</ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>BadgeList as nav-pills</h2>
        <p>
          You can use the <code>BadgeList</code> to render nav-pills with some additional css classes.
        </p>
        <ul class="nav nav-pills" role="tablist" wicket:id="badge-list-pills">[]</ul>
